I have tried to code some random problems in java or c

1. Printing the numbers in spiral form, up to a given number, for eg. number = 24, in the correct formatting                     
                          
                          21 22 23 24
                          20 7  8  9  10
                          19 6  1  2  11
                          18 5  4  3  12
                          17 16 15 14 13  (Spiral.java)
             

2. A simple encryption and decryption method, to encrypt a given number(each digit is added with key(incremented))
          
          for eg. number = 1111111, key = 1(i.e, the addition will start with 1)
          encrypted number will be : ((1+1)(1+2)(1+3)(1+4)(1+5)(1+6)(1+7)) = 2345678
          for numbers like (8+9) = 17, we have to take mod i.e, 17 % 9 = 8
          another eg.  number = 1633738 , encrypted number = 6312741
                                          (Encryption.java)

3. Program to print the Fibonacci number of, the given number of Digits;

          for Eg. Number = 3, :- The First 3 digit Fibonacci number is : 144
          with index 12
          Another eg. number = 20, : Fib. no = 12200160415121876738
          with index no. 93
          Note : I have taken the Fib. Series from 0 i.e
          0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 .....
                                          (FibNum.java)
                                          
4. Program to print pattern given below, for only odd numbers :

          x                       x
            x                   x
          x   x               x   x
            x   x           x   x
          x   x   x       x   x   x
            x   x   x   x   x   x
          x   x   x   x   x   x   x
            x   x   x   x   x   x
          x   x   x       x   x   x
            x   x           x   x
          x   x               x   x
            x                   x
          x                       x
          
                                           (Pattern.java)
